    "- **Tenant**: A tenant is the organization that owns and manages a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services. It's most often used to refer to the set of Azure and Microsoft 365 services for an organization.\n",
    "- **Security principal**: An Azure security principal is a security identity that user-created apps, services, and automation tools use to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a \"user identity\" (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. A security principal should only need to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permission level that it needs to perform its management tasks. A security principal used with an application or service is called a service principal. <br> In essence, by using a Service Principal, you avoid creating “fake users” (we would call them service account in on-premises Active Directory…) in Azure AD to manage authentication when you need to access Azure Resources.\n",
    "- **Managed identities**: Azure Key Vault provides a way to securely store credentials and other keys and secrets, but your code needs to authenticate to Key Vault to retrieve them. Using a managed identity makes solving this problem simpler by giving Azure services an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID. <br>\n",
    "Managed Identities are in essence 100% identical in functionality and use case than Service Principals. In fact, they are actually Service Principals.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes them different though, is: – They are always linked to an Azure Resource, not to an application or 3rd party connector – They are automatically created for you, including the credentials; big benefit here is that no one knows the credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Managed Identities exist in 2 formats: – System assigned; in this scenario, the identity is linked to a single Azure Resource, eg a Virtual Machine, a Logic App, a Storage Account, Web App, Function,… so almost anything. Next, they also “live” with the Azure Resource, which means they get deleted when the Azure Resource gets deleted. – User Assigned Managed Identity, which means that you first have to create it as a stand-alone Azure resource by itself, after which it can be linked to multiple Azure Resources.
