'''
This script demonstrates how to use custom functions with an agent in Azure AI.
Youâ€™ll build a simple technical support agent that can collect details of a technical problem and generate a support ticket.
'''

'''
NOTE:
This demo uses the user's Azure login credentials rather than passing API keys directly in the code.

You install the Azure CLI and sign in from your local development environment, so that you can use your user credentials to call Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models.

Install the CLI in your terminal with the following command:
```PowerShell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
```
In linux: curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

In Mac: brew update && brew install azure-cli

After you install the Azure CLI, sign in using the `az login` command and sign-in using the browser

*If az login does not work in your terminal, and you get something like `The term 'az' is not recognized...`, even though the Azure CLI is installed, its executable is not in your system's PATH environment variable, so PowerShell can't find it.

Add the CLI to your System Variables PATH. 
Usually, you can find the CLI in: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin\`
'''

'''
NOTE:
RUNNING THE CODE:
When prompted, enter a prompt such as:
- I have a technical problem
View the response. 
The agent may ask for your email address and a description of the issue.
You can use any email address (for example, jordan@contoso.com) and any issue description (for example my computer won't start)

When it has enough information, the agent should choose to use your function as required.
A txt file will be created in the same directory as this script, with the support ticket details.
